# E-commerce with Kafka
## üìÑ Project Description
Developed during the Alura course, this project simulates an e-commerce system using Apache Kafka as a messaging platform. Implemented in Java, it makes use of Maven as a dependency manager.

## üì¶ Structure
The architecture follows an application style as a collection of services that are:
* Highly maintainable and testable
* Loosely coupled
* Independently deployable
* Organized around business capabilities
* Capable of being developed by a small team.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies
- Java
- Maven
- Apache Kafka
- Docker

## üöÄ How to Run

2. In the "docker-kafka/custom-image" directory, run the following commands:
   - `docker-compose up` to bring up the Kafka container
   - `./start-kafka.sh` to start the Kafka server
3. In the "projects/ecommerce" directory, run the command:
   - `mvn clean install` to install dependencies
4. The project consists of the following services:
   - "EmailService" to simulate email sending.
   - "NewOrderService" to simulate the creation of a new order.
   - "HttpEcommerceService" to simulate communication with an external service.
